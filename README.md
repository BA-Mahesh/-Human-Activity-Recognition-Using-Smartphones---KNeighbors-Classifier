# -Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones---KNeighbors-Classifier
In this project we will design a robust activity recogonition system based on the smartphones. As you know mobile devices have accelerometer as the sensor which collects the activities. These activities can be classified using K-nearest neighbour. 

### REQUIREMENT
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit Learn

## Machine Learning Model Used
1. k-nearest neighbors

## Database Information

The data was collected from 30 subjects aged between 19 and 48 years old performing one of 6 standard activities while wearing a waist-mounted smartphone that recorded the movement data. Video was recorded of each subject performing the activities and the movement data was labeled manually from these videos.

 
### Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### STEPS :
1. Importing Libraries
2. Exploring the Dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Building
    >* KNeighborsClassifier
6. Evaluation
7. Conclusion
